# ArduinoCommandProcessor
This program provides a simple command processor for use with an Arduino ATMega 2560. This displays
command options over a serial connection. I used PuTTy as my terminal simulator. This provides 5 commands
which display data from connected sensors, adjust a setting, and generate a tone on a simple speaker. The
tone is generated as a square wave which can be observed using an oscilloscope as well.
